> View protocol has one requirement: a computed property called Body that
> returns `some View`

> Modifiers (`.padding()` for instance) return the original View plus the extra
> modification you asked for.

SwiftUI has a limit of 10 children views per parent view. Get around it with
Group. Groups don't change things visually.

Use `Section` to split the view visually.

`Safe Area` keeps views out of eg the menu bar. Use a `NavigationView` to keep
content from scrolling up there.

Navigation Titles are added to children of `NavigationView`

"Views are a function of their state"

Property Wrappers allow struct properties to eg be mutable even though they're
in a Struct. `@State` allows a property to be stored by SwiftUI somewhere that
it can be modified. Recommended to use `private` with these.

Two-way bindings: when a view needs to write back a value that it's also
reading. Done with `$` in front of the var name eg
`TextField("hi", text: $name)`

`ForEach` creates views in a loop. Another way to get around the 10 child view
limit.

Optionals

Three ways to unwrap:
- `if let`
- `guard let`
- nil coalescing `??`

Protocols and Extensions

>  if you’re returning a new value rather than changing it in place, you should
>  use word endings like ed or ing, like reversed(). reverse() would change in
>  place.

**Arrays**
```swift
// create explicitly with generic syntax
var scores = Array<Int>()

// create with array syntax
var albums = [String]()
var albums: [String] = ["Red"]

// or implicitly
var names = ["brian"]

// remove at an index
names.remove(at: 0)
names.removeAll()

names.reverse()
```

**Dictionaries**
```swift
// create with dictionary syntax
var heights = [String: Int]()
heights["Yao Ming"] = 229
// this returns an Optional Int
heights["Yao Ming"]
// to receive an Int
heights["Yao Ming", default: 0]
```

**Sets**

```swift
// implicit, from an array.
let people = Set(["brian", "sara", "price"])
// or
let people = Set<String>()
people.insert("brian")
```

**Enums**
```swift
enum Weekday {
  case monday, tuesday, wednesday, thursday, friday
}

var day = Weekday.monday
day = .tuesday // shorthand, swift knows day's type
```
